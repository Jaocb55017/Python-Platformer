2D platformer created in Python
This thread contains the logic for my game, I have put this here for you to get an understanding of my logic and OOP ability. Hopefully this is a good enough representation of my coding. It involves Reading/Writing/GUI creation, frame updates and user input. Graphical generation and saving scores. Physics logic and utilising arrays.
